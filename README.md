# salary_us
US salaries.  Hi tech
Project focus is to scrap salary data for hi tech positions in the US.

Running into multiple issues with selenium timing out for the scraper.  Seems to 
be an issue from my research.  Did some troubleshooting with [wait]("https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/waits.html")
but code still crashed.  Spent too much time, may try using beautiful soup later.)
